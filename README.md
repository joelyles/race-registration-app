# Race Registration Frontend

This frontend is a demo race homepage and registration form. Below is a list of steps in the process, features, and tech that I used to create it.

---

- created [vite + react](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) app using **npm create vite@latest race-registration-app**
- selected **react** framework
- opened race-registration-app directory
- updated default port to 3001 in vite.config.js
- installed [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite) with **npm i -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer**
- created tailwind and postcss .config.js with **npx tailwindcss init -p**
